### Abstract

Food waste is a significant problem in the modern world, as about one-third of the food produced for human consumption gets wasted annually. A significant and reducible portion of food waste comes from restaurants due to unfinished food. This thesis aims to identify and solve the challenges in monitoring food waste in an oncampus restaurant to help restaurant managers make data-driven decisions toward its reduction. This research took over a year, during which, from 10 cameras, we collected a total of around 22000 hours (55 TB) of videos. Due to the enormous magnitude of video data, manual analysis was infeasible. Thus, deep learning approaches were needed to process the video data and extract food waste information computationally. Also, a data visualization dashboard was needed to help summarize the information and quickly discover valuable insights.

We used computer vision and data visualization tools to build deep learning models to extract food tray images from camera videos, classify dishes and quantities of food waste from those images, and creating dashboards for data analysis. We designed an active learning approach to create models for efficient dish classification and built a visual analytics (VA) system to monitor the modelâ€™s performance over several
months. The best dish classification model achieved 91.2% accuracy for eight categories of dishes.

During our research, we conducted several surveys and interviews with end-users and domain experts to gather requirements and test the usefulness of deep learning models, the VA system, and dashboards. The data analysts were satisfied with the design of the final dashboard, and the model developers were satisfied with the models for tray image extraction, dish classification, VA system, and prototype for quantity classification. However, quantity classification needs deeper exploration. The approaches from this research can be extended to many restaurants worldwide to reduce food waste.
